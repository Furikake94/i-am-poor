Repository for my expense tracker - my first python project started on Dec 10 2020

This script creates a db, allows 3 basic functions: view, insert and delete amount.
While work proceeds the goal is to make every function dependant on user input for initialization and details, trying to keep inputs sanitized and prevent loops or bad injections.
Goals for this project are: 
- add data analysis (average expenses/month, highest category and so on)
- create a GUI
- possibly exportation on Excel to view the data
- packing it so that it can be launched without using cmd
- connect with banking APIs Ã  la YNAB/Mint (not sure if possible at all)

Being my first project I am more or less learning by doing, so any input and advice are welcome.
